In this magisterial work by the Italian intellectual superstar Roberto Calasso, figures of the Bible and its whole outline emerge in a new light: one that is often astonishing and disquieting, as indeed--more than any other--is the book from which they originate  Roberto Calasso\\'s The Book of All Books is a narration that moves through the Bible as if through a forest, where every branch--every verse--may offer some revelation. Where a man named Saul becomes the first king of a people because his father sent him off to search for some donkeys that had gone astray. Where, in answer to an invitation from Jerusalem\\'s king, the queen of a remote African realm spends three years leading a long caravan of young men, girls dressed in purple, and animals, and with large quantities of spices, to ask the king certain questions. And where a man named Abraham hears these words from a divine voice: \"Go away from your land, from your country and from the house of your father toward the land that I will show you\"--words that reverberate throughout the Bible, a story about a separation and a promise followed by many other separations and promises.  The Book of All Books, the tenth part of a series, parallels in many ways the second part, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony. There, gods and heroes of the Greek myths revealed new physiognomies, whereas here many figures of the Bible and its whole outline emerge in a new light: one that is often astonishing and disquieting, as indeed is the book--more so than any other--from which they originate.', 'Bible Study & Reference', 1, 4.2, 7, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

Schein\\'s diverse and memorable cast includes southern Jewish lawyer Murray Gold and his foil, displaced New York psychiatrist Bert Levy; emotionally scarred USMC drill sergeant Jack McGowan and his alluring and unconventional wife, Mary Beth; corrupt and adulterous sheriff Hoke Cooley, his deeply conservative wife, Regina, and their violent son, Boonie; African American madam and later city councilwoman Lila Trulove (also Hoke\\'s mistress), her brilliant daughter, Elizabeth, and her conflicted Harvard-bound son, Driver; fallen southern belle turned voice of a generation Arlanne Palmer; remorseful Vietnam veteran and flamboyant transvestite Royal Cunningham; and inspirational schoolteacher Pat Conroy. Famous all over Town also uses its web of interconnected storylines to make its setting, the eponymous town itself, a central character with a personality and an arc as complete as that of any other member of the deftly rendered cast.Delving beneath the surface of the southern status quo, Schein\\'s tale follows these interconnected lives through the private and public upheavals in small-town life from the turbulent 1960s to the eve of the new millennium, confronting the ramifications of the civil rights era, Vietnam, Watergate, and―closer to home―a deadly version of the infamous Ribbon Creek incident. Somerset\\'s colorful citizens also confront their own repressed memories, conflicted identities, burgeoning ambitions, and romantic entanglements. Even as events unfold to often-uproarious effect, Schein\\'s novel holds true to a deeply realized sense of intimacy and authenticity in the interactions of its myriad characters as revelations expose how these disparate lives are conjoined in surprising ways. Shifting points of view place readers squarely in the mindsets of many of Somerset\\'s key citizens as Schein lovingly and laughingly invites us to reconsider what it means in the modern south to be white, black, Jewish, Christian, military, civilian, sane, insane, old, young, male, female, gay, and straight―and to be of a place rather than merely in it. Best-selling southern novelist and self-described \"Florida cracker\" Janis Owens, author of American Ghost, The Cracker Kitchen, and other books, provides a foreword.', 'United States, Literary, Genre Fiction, World Literature', 4, 4.1, 5, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

Asian American Studies. In THE FAMILY CHINA, her second book of poems, Ann Shin examines the decentering experiences of migration, loss and death, and the impulse to build anew. In five suites threaded through with footnote-like fragments that haunt and ambush the text like memories, the book accrues associations, building and transforming images from poem to poem, creating a layered and cohesive collection that asks daring questions about how we define ourselves.These poems grapple rawly and musically with the profound messiness of human relations; their candour consoles and instructs. The quandaries in THE FAMILY CHINA are deeply recognizable. Strung up between fragility and resilience, between naïve hope and domestic disillusionment, between an untenable nostalgia for the pastoral and a deep unease with the global, the voice of these poems is nevertheless determined to find some scrap of a song we can sing in common.\"This short, dazzling collection of poems contains a universe—nothing short of North American life in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. Somehow it is all here, joyously offered up, birth, death, and everything in between, including the suspect investment schemes of the heart (and the bank), the modern war in relationships and families, the dark-light, pastoral dream of childhood, the carried-over costs of immigration and exile....\"—Karen Connelly', 'Poetry', 1, 3.9, 3, 'Average', 'Sad')\n",

Karlan is a unique figure in American law. A professor at Stanford Law School and former counsel for the NAACP, she has argued seven cases at the Supreme Court and worked on dozens more as a clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun. In her first book written for a general audience, she examines what happens in American courtrooms―especially the Supreme Court―and what it means for our everyday lives and to our national commitments to democracy, justice, and fairness. \\nThrough an exploration of current hot-button legal issues―from voting rights to the death penalty, health care, same-sex marriage, invasive high-tech searches, and gun control―Karlan makes a sophisticated and resonant case for her vision of the Constitution. At the heart of that vision is the conviction that the Constitution is an evolving document that enables government to solve novel problems and expand the sphere of human freedom. As skeptics charge congressional overreach on such issues as the Affordable Care Act and even voting rights, Karlan pushes back. On individual rights in particular, she believes the Constitution allows Congress to enforce the substance of its amendments. And she calls out the Roberts Court for its disdain for the other branches of government and for its alignment with a conservative agenda.', 'Constitutional Law, Politics & Government', 2, 3.9, 4, 'Average', 'Sad')\n",

Nicholas Volkov has one goal: to make sure when he becomes president over the hierarchical society of Newland that he doesn't follow in his tyrannical father's footsteps. After Heidi registers for Savage Run, Nicholas discovers that she's a girl. Being a rebel in his own right, Nicholas doesn't turn her in, but decides to help in any way possible. Heidi struggles through the obstacle courses in Savage Run. Physically and emotionally drained, it is only during downtime between events that she's able to make sense of her world and get a little closer to the secretive Nicholas. But with the threat of death constantly barreling down on her, and with menacing contestants looming around every obstacle, she realizes that the chances of her getting killed are far greater than winning her freedom. In this action-packed, suspense-filled novel, E. J. Squires takes us through a wild ride that explores how far one would go to gain one's freedom.

The tabloids trumpeted scandal: Kurosawa had himself gone mad; his associates had betrayed him; Hollywood was engaged in a conspiracy.Now, for the first time, the truth behind the downfall and humiliation of one of cinema's greatest perfectionists is revealed in All the Emperor's Men.

Boehme discourses at length here on one of the fundamental laws of Magic: the law of signatures, the concept that every object in the real world has some hidden meaning, and particularly how these signatures interact.At the core of Boehme's philosophy is a mystical Christianity. However, his beliefs were far from that of the Lutheran establishment, and he was persecuted his entire life. Boehme's view of a universe where a creative and destructive principle are in conflict was later repurposed by Hegel as the dialectic. Newton, Nietzsche, the Quaker George Fox, and even Phillip K. Dick have all been cited as being influenced by Boehme. (Quote from sacred-texts.com)About the AuthorJacob Boehme (1575 - 1624)Bohme was born in eastern Germany, near Gorlitz. He grew up as a Lutheran, and worked as a shoemaker in Gorlitz.Bohme had mystical experiences throughout his youth, culminating in a vision in 1600 that he received through observing the exquisite beauty of a beam of sunlight reflected in a pewter dish. He believed this vision revealed to him the spiritual structure of the world, as well as the relationship between God and man, and good and evil. At the time he chose not to speak of this experience openly, preferring instead to continue his work and raise a family.

After discovering evidence of a mole in the organization, Jason goes deep undercover to find the man behind the kill order. Guilt, a dark secret from his past, and the need to protect Avery’s daughter, prevents Jason from returning to Emily and exposing her to the dangerous elements of his job. Instead of being with her, he watches and guards her from a distance, refusing to accept that rejecting her hurts both of them. Emily is ready to prove she’s stronger than Jason realizes. Accepting the man she loves is alive and avoiding her is not an option. She’s determined to finish her training with her father’s black ops organization, IATO, find the answers haunting her past, and once and for all, prove she can take care of herself. When she discovers ties between the old car bombing that killed her father and the terrorists she’s investigating, she finagles an assignment on to Jason’s team and their next IATO mission. She will get the stolen nanotech chip back from the arms dealer looking to broker the secret technology to the terrorists and investigate the contact to her father’s death. The Monte Carlo Affair, Book 2 The balance of world power drops into Emily’s inexperienced hands, and she is forced to play a dangerous game of seduction with Mosel Reinhardt, the notorious international arms dealer, while her team and Jason look on. Is Reinhardt peddling the nanotech chip technology, or are Emily’s instincts about him correct? The mission heats up when Jason finds he can no longer resist her—his old friend’s daughter, the agency computer genius has gone femme fatale and she’s too hot for him to handle, and neither can Mosel. The man who’s never cared about anyone or anything actually seems to care about Emily. After years of waiting to have her again, the tables turn on Jason. He’s unwilling to share her with anyone, let alone his oldest rival, even for the mission. But will he be able to watch her seduce Mosel in order to find her father’s killer and stop the madness? Would she stop if he asked her? Cyber Seduction, Book 3 Emily and Jason barely escape Monte Carlo with their identities intact after retrieving the nanotech chip, and then once again Jason distances himself from Emily. The continued plan includes enticing Mosel to follow Emily back to Washington, DC where they expect him to meet with the terrorists and their contact. The danger to her escalates but it’s imperative they uncover the mole in their agency. The tables turn on Jason and Emily when he risks everything to get the answers he’s been looking for and is captured. Emily takes a risk and enlists Mosel’s help to save him. As the story unravels, convoluted secrets from the past surface, expose old guilt and childish misconceptions, and finally shed light on old nightmares.', 'Thrillers & Suspense, Romantic Suspense, Military', 3, 4.7, 5, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

To reflect on method implies for Agamben an archaeological vigilance: a persistent form of thinking in order to expose, examine, and elaborate what is obscure, unanalyzed, even unsaid, in an author's thought. To be archaeologically vigilant, then, is to return to, even invent, a method attuned to a “world supported by a thick weave of resemblances and sympathies, analogies and correspondences.” Collecting a wide range of authors and topics in a slim but richly argued volume, Agamben enacts the search to create a science of signatures that exceeds the attempts of semiology and hermeneutics to determine the pure and unmarked signs that signify univocally, neutrally, and eternally. Three conceptual figures organize Agamben's argument and the advent of his new method: the paradigm, the signature, and archaeology. Each chapter is devoted to an investigation of one of these concepts and Agamben carefully constructs its genealogy transhistorically and from an interdisciplinary perspective. And at each moment of the text, Agamben pays tribute to Michel Foucault, whose methods he rethinks and effectively uses to reformulate the logic of the concepts he isolates. The Signature of All Things reveals once again why Agamben is one of the most innovative thinkers writing today.\", 'Philosophy, Archaeology', 2, 3.9, 6, 'Average', 'Sad')\n",

Kids will be able to practice and hone their developing reading skills as they eagerly turn the brightly illustrated pages to see what Blippi does next! Includes the following Blippi titles: If I Were a Dinosaur, I Can Drive an Excavator, This is My Neighborhood, and A Pet for Blippi. Perfect for young readers ages 5 to 7.\\\\nFrom School Library Journal\\\\nK-Gr 2-Early readers will enjoy four fun stories featuring educational YouTube sensation Blippi. This story collection includes A Pet For Blippi!, I Can Drive an Excavator!, This is My Neighborhood!, and If I Were a Dinosaur! The upbeat and cheerful text in this Level 1 for early readers is repetitive and has a simple vocabulary. Each page contains just a few short sentences. In A Pet for Blippi!, Blippi volunteers at an animal shelter. By the end of the day, he has found a new friend for himself-a puppy named Lyno. In If I Were a Dinosaur!, Blippi joyfully shares how he can stomp, fly, and have horns, just like the dinosaurs at the museum. The illustrations directly reinforce the text with their bright colors and clean lines. For example, when the text says that Blippi takes Lyno for a walk, the illustrations perfectly match, with Blippi and Lyno walking. The illustrations are reminiscent of old-school animation with a sweet, cartoonlike quality. VERDICT A great book for Blippi fans, or for libraries that need early reader books.-V.

Debut novelist Alix Hawley presents Boone\\'s life, from his childhood in a Quaker colony, through two stints captured by Indians as he attempted to settle Kentucky, the death of one son at the hands of the same Indians, and the rescue of one daughter. The prose rivals Hilary Mantel\\'s and Peter Carey\\'s, conveying that sense of being inside the head of a storied historical figure about which much nonsense is spoken while also feeling completely contemporary. Boone was a fabulous hunter and explorer, and a \"white Indian,\" perhaps happiest when he found a place as the captive, adopted son of a chief who was trying to prevent the white settlement of Kentucky. Hawley takes us intimately into the life-and-death survival of people pushing away from security and into Indian lands, despite sense and treaties, just before and into the War of Independence. The love story between Boone and his wife, Rebecca, is rich and tangled, but mostly it\\'s Boone who fascinates, pushing into places where he imagines he can create a new \"clean\" world, only to find death and trouble and complication. He is a fabulous character, unrivalled in North American literature, and a prime candidate for the tall tale. The storytelling is taut and expert, the descriptions rich and powerful, the prose full of feeling, but Boone is what drives this outstanding debut.', 'United States, Literary, Genre Fiction', 3, 4.6, 5, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

The hallmarks of her style, so finely wrought in the award-winning Tongues of Flame (1986)--the fully realized characters, her deep sensitivity, a defining sense of place and time--are back in all their richness to involve and enchant the reader.\\nAll but one of the stories are set in Alabama. They deal with dramatic turning points in the lives of charcaters who happen to be southerners, many jaxtaposed between Old South sensibility and manners and New South modernity and expectations. Among these is a new widow who is not consoled by well-meaning, proselytizing Christians; a middle-aged waitress in love with the town \"catch\"; a bedridden belle dependent upon her black nurse; a \"special\" young man in a newspaper shop; a young faculty wife who attempts generosity with a lower-class neighbor; and a lawyer caught in the dilemma of race issues. Through their diverse voices, Brown proves herself a graceful and gifted storyteller who writes with an authoritative pen, inventing and inhabiting the worlds of her set of characters with insight, compassion, and wit.\\nMost of the stories in It Wasn\\'t All Dancing have appeared previously in prominent national magazines and literary journals, including the Atlantinc Monthly, Grand Street,  and Threepenny Review. This fine collection should appeal to a wide audience among writers, literature scholars, and general readers alike.\\nMary Ward Brown won the 1987 PEN/Hemingway Award, the 1991 Lillian Smith Award, and the 1987 Alabama Library Association Award for her first collection of short storied, Tounges of Flame.

This witty, wry, and unique new book rectifies that wrong. Part detective story, part history lesson, part exposé, The Book of Lost Books is the first guide to literature’s what-ifs and never-weres.In compulsively readable fashion, Stuart Kelly reveals details about tantalizing vanished works by the famous, the acclaimed, and the influential, from the time of cave drawings to the late twentieth century. Here are the true stories behind stories, poems, and plays that now exist only in imagination:·Aristophanes’ Heracles, the Stage Manager was one of the playwright’s several spoofs that disappeared.·Love’s Labours Won may have been a sequel to Shakespeare’s Love’s Labours Lost–or was it just an alternative title for The Taming of the Shrew?·Jane Austen’s incomplete novel Sanditon, was a critique of hypochondriacs and cures started when the author was fatally ill.·Nikolai Gogol burned the second half of Dead Souls after a religious conversion convinced him that literature was paganism.·Some of the thousand pages of William Burroughs’s original Naked Lunch were stolen and sold on the street by Algerian street boys.·Sylvia Plath’s widower, Ted Hughes, claimed that the 130 pages of her second novel, perhaps based on their marriage, were lost after her death.Whether destroyed (Socrates’ versions of Aesop’s Fables), misplaced (Malcolm Lowry’s Ultramarine was pinched from his publisher’s car), interrupted by the author’s death (Robert Louis Stevenson’s Weir of Hermiston), or simply never begun (Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, America, a second volume of his memoirs), these missing links create a history of literature for a parallel world.

Williams, representing a diverse range of political and personal points of view that illuminate The Nation’s steadfast commitment to racial justice, each infused with the moral passion and urgency that the subject demands. The writers in this anthology have addressed these questions not to embitter but to provoke, educate, arouse, and inspire. James Baldwin once wrote that “the story of the Negro in America is the story of America.... It is not a very pretty story.” Baldwin and others in this collection shed light on the ugliness of American racism to certify that it is intolerable, that America can—must—do better. “The Nation’s editors ... have provided space for those persistent and ... often lonely voices inveighing against the evils of racial injustice.”—Derrick Bell', 'Americas, Social Sciences, Politics & Government', 3, 4.7, 9, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

The New York City Police Department is the largest police agency in the United States, with over 35,000 members. A police force that large is going to have more than a few colorful characters and unbelievable stories. Retired NYPD Detective Vic Ferrari takes you behind the scenes as he peels back the onion, revealing the good, the bad, and the ugly of the New York City Police Department. The NYPD's Flying Circus picks up where NYPD: Through the Looking Glass left off in this controversial tell-all sequel. The NYPD’s Flying Circus is an introspective, behind-the-scenes look into the New York City Police Department. Cops, crime and chaos are sarcastically woven together through the eyes of a retired NYPD detective, exposing the funnier side of the NYPD—a fascinating history lesson wrapped in personal anecdotes covering a twenty-year law enforcement career.

In Katherine Clark\\'s All the Governor\\'s Men, a political comedy of manners that reimagines Wallace\\'s last campaign, voters face a clear choice between the infamous segregationist, now a crippled old man in a wheelchair, and his primary opponent, Aaron Osgood, a progressive young candidate poised to liberate the state from its George Wallace-poisoned past. Daniel Dobbs, a twenty one-year-old Harvard graduate and South Alabama native, is one of many young people who have joined the campaign representing hope and change for a downtrodden Alabama. A political animal himself, Daniel possesses so much charm and charisma that he was nicknamed \"the Governor\" in college. Nowhe is engaged in the struggle to conquer once and for all the malignant man Alabamians have traditionally called \"the Governor.\" This historic election isn\\'t the only thing Daniel wants to win. During his senior year, he fell in love with a freshman girl from Mountain Brook, the \"Tiny Kingdom\" of wealth and privilege, a world apart from his own Alabama origins. A small-town country boy, Daniel desperately wants to gain the favor of his girlfriend\\'s family along with her mentor, the larger-than-life English teacher Norman Laney. Daniel also wants to keep one or two ex-girlfriends firmly out of the picture. In the course of his summer, he must untangle his complicated personal life, satisfy the middle-class dreams of his parents for their Harvard-educated son, decide whether to enter law school or launch his own political career, and, incidentally, help his candidate defeat George Wallace, in a close and increasingly dirty race. All the Governor\\'s Men is a darkly comic look at both the political process in general and a significant political chapter in Alabama history. This second novel in Katherine Clark\\'s Mountain Brook series depicts the social and political landscape of an Alabama world that is at once a place like no other and at the same time, a place like all others.', 'United States, Literary, Genre Fiction, Politics & Government', 4, 4.5, 12, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

The result was an unlikely children\\'s classic, The Cat in the Hat. But Geisel didn\\'t stop there. Using The Cat in the Hat as a template, he teamed with Helen Geisel and Phyllis Cerf to create Beginner Books, a whole new category of readers that combined research-based literacy practices with the logical insanity of Dr. Seuss.  The books were an enormous success, giving the world such authors and illustrators as P. D. Eastman, Roy McKie, and Stan and Jan Berenstain, and beloved bestsellers such as Are You My Mother?; Go, Dog. Go!; Put Me in the Zoo; and Green Eggs and Ham.  The story of Beginner Books-and Ted Geisel\\'s role as \"\"president, policymaker, and editor\"\" of the line for thirty years-has been told briefly in various biographies of Dr. Seuss, but I Can Read It All by Myself: The Beginner Books Story presents it in full detail for the first time.

She thought she'd have some time to adjust before introducing her daughter to Jace Dawson, the father her little girl has never known. Instead, within days of her arrival, her house burns down and she and Tilly have no choice but to move in with the sexy cowboy himself at the Prairie Rose ranch. Now the whole Dawson clan-heck, the whole town of Happy-is all up in their business.   Jace has dealt with stubborn bulls and bucking broncos-but being a dad? He is so not ready for this... Yet the more time he spends with Carlene and little Tilly, the harder it is to imagine life without them. Now he just has to convince Carlene that he's the real deal-and hope that this time she's here to stay.   HOMETOWN COWBOY by Sara Richardson Outrageously handsome Lance Cortez is practically a living legend in Colorado, as famous for riding bulls as he is for breaking hearts. What would a big-time cowboy star like him see in a small-town veterinarian who wears glasses, rescues animals, and cries when watching rom-coms? Turns out, plenty.   For fans of Debbie Macomber or Lori Wilde, these cowboy romances deliver a heartwarming read full of feels.

The movement to use the power of local governments to furnish rate-supported library service for citizens was a successful Victorian and Edwardian thrust. Today, more than 500 public libraries span the province, serving as intermediary points between authors and readers and providing a wide scope of information and programming services for educational and recreational purposes.

By: Edward Lear, with all the original illustrations: (Children's Classics)\", 4.99, 'Low Price', 0.907272727, 'LEAR, Edward', '12-10-2017', 2017, 'CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform', 'Low', 'Paperback', 6, 'Moderate Age', 250, 1529072, 11, 'Edward Lear (12 or 13 May 1812 – 29 January 1888) was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, and is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised. His principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to illustrate birds and animals; making coloured drawings during his journeys, which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books; as a (minor) illustrator of Alfred Tennyson\\'s poems. As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson\\'s poetry. Early years: Lear was born into a middle-class family at Holloway, North London, the penultimate of twenty-one children (and youngest to survive) of Ann Clark Skerrett and Jeremiah Lear, a stockbroker formerly working for the family sugar refining business.He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior. Jeremiah Lear ended up defaulting to the London Stock Exchange in the economic upheaval following the Napoleonic Wars; owing to the family\\'s now more limited finances, Lear and his sister were required to leave the family home, Bowmans Lodge, and live together when he was aged four. Ann doted on Edward and continued to act as a mother for him until her death, when he was almost 50 years of age. Lear suffered from lifelong health afflictions. From the age of six he suffered frequent grand mal epileptic seizures, and bronchitis, asthma, and during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. Lear felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition. His adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He suffered from periods of severe melancholia which he referred to as \"the Morbids.\" Artist: Lear was already drawing \"for bread and cheese\" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious \"ornithological draughtsman\" employed by the Zoological Society and then from 1832 to 1836 by the Earl of Derby, who kept a private menagerie at his estate, Knowsley Hall. He was the first major bird artist to draw birds from real live birds, instead of skins. Lear\\'s first publication, published when he was 19 years old, was Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots in 1830.One of the greatest ornithological artists of his era, he taught Elizabeth Gould whilst also contributing to John Gould\\'s works and was compared favourably with the naturalist John James Audubon. Unfortunately his eyesight deteriorated too much to work with such precision on the fine drawings and etchings of plates used in lithography, thus he turned to landscape painting and travel. Among other travels, he visited Greece and Egypt during 1848–49, and toured India during 1873–75, including a brief detour to Ceylon. While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured wash drawings in a distinctive style, which he converted later in his studio into oil and watercolour paintings, as well as prints for his books. His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour. Between 1878 and 1883 Lear spent his summers on Monte Generoso, a mountain on the border between the Swiss canton of Ticino and the Italian region of Lombardy. His oil painting The Plains of Lombardy from Monte Generoso is in the Ashmolean Museum in the English city of Oxford.Throughout his life he continued to paint seriously. He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate Tennyson\\'s poems; near the end of his life a volume with a small number of illustrations was published...................', 'Literary', 1, 4.5, 12, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Yet in spite of his immense popularity and later prestige (he was elected to the Academie Française in 1968), he has remained largely unknown to English-speaking readers. Ezra Pound, shortly after arriving in Paris in 1920, made contact with Morand and, always ready to champion new and distinct voices, was soon translating his short stories for the British publishers Chapman and Dodd. In the end, however, the translations were rejected as ''unsuitable, '' partially on the grounds of sexual frankness. The typescripts, left for safekeeping with William Bird's Paris-based Three Mountains Press, were rediscovered in the mid-1970s and are published here for the first time.As might be expected, the energy and originality of Morand's style is matched by Pound's inventive genius.

Nonetheless, children still bring to literacy a wide range of experiences and competencies. How, then, might teachers best support a literate community yet still meet the needs of individual readers? For Fountas and Pinnell, the answer lies in guided reading, which allows children to develop as individual readers within the context of a small group. Their new book is the richest, most comprehensive guided reading resource available today and the first systematic offering of instructional support for guided reading adherents.   Guided Reading was written for K-3 classroom teachers, reading resource teachers, teacher educators, preservice teachers, researchers, administrators, and staff developers. Based on the authors\\' nine years of research and development, it explains how to create a balanced literacy program based on guided reading and supported by read aloud, shared reading, interactive writing, and other approaches. While there is an entire chapter devoted solely to the process by which children become literate, every chapter clearly presents the theoretical underpinnings of the practices it suggests. Also included are guidelines for:  \\nobservation and assessment \\ndynamic grouping of readers \\ncreating sets of leveled books \\nselecting and introducing books \\nteaching for strategies \\nclassroom management.  \\nBest of all, there are well over 2,500 leveled books in the Appendixes, along with many other reproducible resources that teachers will use for years to come. \"Good first teaching is the foundation of education and the right of every child,\" assert the authors.

Labadie (1850-1933), Detroit\\'s prominent labor organizer and one of early labor\\'s most influential activists. A dynamic participant in the major social reform movements of the Gilded Age, Labadie was a central figure in the pervasive struggle for a new social order as the American Midwestunderwent rapid industrialization at the endof the nineteenth century.\\nThis engaging biography follows Labadie\\'s colorful career from a childhood among a Pottawatomi tribe in the Michigan woods through his local and national involvement in a maze of late nineteenth-century labor and reform activities, including participation in the Socialist Labor party, Knights of Labor, Greenback movement, trades councils, typographical union, eight-hour-day campaigns, and the rise of the American Federation of Labor. \\nAlthough he received almost no formal education, Labadie was a critical thinker and writer, contributing a column titled \"Cranky Notions\" to Benjamin Tucker\\'s Liberty, the most important journal of American anarchism. He interacted with such influential rebels and reformers as Eugene V. Debs, Emma Goldman, Henry George, Samuel Gompers, and Terence V. Powderly, and was also a poet of both protest and sentiment, composing more than five hundred poems between 1900 and 1920.\\nAffectionately known as Detroit\\'s \"Gentle Anarchist,\" Labadie\\'s flamboyant and amiable personality counteracted his caustic writings, making him one of the city\\'s most popular figures throughout his long life despite his dissident ideas. His individualist anarchist philosophy was also balanced by his conventional personal life-he was married to a devout Catholic and even worked for the city\\'s water commission to make ends meet.\\nIn writing this biography of her grandfather, Carlotta R. Anderson consulted the renowned Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a unique collection of protest literature which extensively documents pivotal times in American labor history and radical history. She also had available a large collection of family scrapbooks, letters, photographs, and Labadie\\'s personal account book. Including passages from Labadie\\'s vast writings, poems, and letters, All-American Anarchist traces America\\'s recurring anti-anarchist and anti-radical frenzy and repression, from the 1886 Haymarket bombing backlash to the Red Scares of the twentieth century.', 'Historical, Leaders & Notable People, Economics, Americas, Social Sciences, Politics & Government', 6, 4.6, 12, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Three years ago, on the occasion of the Faraday lecture, I made an attempt to arouse the interest of chemists in these matters, but the result was not very encouraging.

Lifelong readers need passion, agency, and a sense of inquiry in their reading lives. They also need books. InIt\\'s All About the Books,Tammy Mulligan and Clare Landrigan share the systems they have developed over the last 15 years to create classroom libraries and book rooms that support both student choice and instructional goals. Getting started with designing and provisioning classroom libraries and bookrooms to support lifelong readers involves collaboration, planning, and some elbow grease! It\\'s All About the Books is a practical yet detailed guide to creating a system where classroom libraries and bookrooms work seamlessly together to make it easy for teachers to find books to engage and scaffold all students in a school community. Each chapter includes photos, resources, book lists, and a step-by-step outline of the process so you can get started right away. From design, to inventory, to organizing, purchasing, and using these books in the classroom-they demonstrate how to make the most of what you have, and how to get what need on a budget. Every child deserves the opportunity to become a lifelong reader. It\\'s All About the Books will help you transform how you organize books across the entire school to make each teacher\\'s book supply seem endless in the eyes of a reader. Teachers must have easy access to what they need, when they need it, because in the life of a reader the right book at the right time makes all the difference. - Tammy and Clare want this book to impact the lives of teachers and students directly so they are donating all author royalties it generates to the Book Love Foundation. Book Love is a not-for-profit organization founded by Penny Kittle with one goal: to put books in the hands of teenagers. Our book will now expand that goal and put books into the hands of elementary and middle grade students as well. Thank you, Penny, for allowing us to bring the heart of this book to life through your hard work and vision. -Tammy and Clare', 'Social Sciences, Schools & Teaching', 2, 4.1, 9, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

Yet now, for the first time, more people are living in urban rather than rural areas, bringing about an estrangement. This book, by acclaimed author Jules Pretty, is fundamentally about our relationship with nature, animals and places. A series of interlinked essays leads readers on a voyage that weaves through the themes of connection and estrangement between humans and nature. The journey shows how our modern lifestyles and economies would need six or eight Earths if the entire world\\x92s population adopted our profligate ways. Pretty shows that we are rendering our own world inhospitable and so risk losing what it means to be human: unless we make substantial changes, Gaia threatens to become Grendel. Ultimately, however, the book offers glimpses of an optimistic future for humanity, in the very face of climate change and pending global environmental catastrophe.', 'Kitchen Appliances', 1, 4.4, 9, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

A complex work that explores many themes to which Nietzsche later returned, it marks a significant departure from his previous thinking. Here Nietzsche breaks with his early allegiance to Schopenhauer and Wagner, and establishes the overall framework of his later philosophy. In contrast to his previous disdain for science, now Nietzsche views science as key to undercutting traditional metaphysics. This he sees as a crucial step in the emergence of free spirits who will be the avant-garde of culture. In summing up the crucial change of perspective expressed in Human, All Too Human, Nietzsche used the following words in his later work Ecce Homo:\"Human, All Too Human is a memorial of a crisis.... [W]ith this book I liberated myself from that in my nature which did not belong to me. Idealism does not belong to me...realities were altogether lacking in my knowledge, and the \\'idealities\\' were worth damn all!

In this story we follow the journey of one proton who comes into existence at the beginning of creation and makes it all the way through history to today. By becoming a part of atoms and molecules that turn up at some of the universe's most important moments, our friend Proton witnesses emerging galaxies, the origin of life, its evolution into a wild diversity of life forms, the first human beings, the birth and life of Jesus, the beginnings of the Christian church, all the way up to the present day. Through it all, the mysterious, seemingly unbelievable plans of the Creator continue to unfold. . . . Combining its authors' mind-bending scientific knowledge, storytelling skills, and insights from theology, Dawn provides a fresh look at the fundamentals of cosmology, evolutionary biology, and the good news of God in one overarching adventure--in the form of a gripping story. Readers who love both science and Scripture will discover an engaging, thought-provoking tale that reminds us we each have a big place in God's plan of creation--even if we're very, very small.

Since entering the league as the thirty-fifth pick of the 2012 NBA Draft, Draymond Green has crafted his way as one of the best in the game on both ends of the floor. With a high degree of skill on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor, Draymond played a key role in the Warriors' 2015, 2017 and 2018 championship runs.It should come as no surprise that Jerry West once called Draymond one of the top ten players in the league during the 2015-2016 NBA season. Few big men have the multiple skillsets that Draymond possesses, making Draymond an asset to any team that he plays for. It will be exciting to see where Draymond's career goes, as he already is a three-time NBA Champion at the young age of 29.

Even fewer do so earning a very lucrative, multimillion-dollar contract. There are some that need a few years of development to prove themselves worthy of being a star in the league. Often times, some players need to be in a system that fits their style of play and with the perfect coach that trusts and believes in his abilities.\\nOne would put the legendary defensive and rebounding force Dennis Rodman in that category. Rodman was never highly touted coming out of college. What he lacked in skill and star power, he more than made up for with his hustle, emotional drive, and insatiable hunger to compete at the highest level. Had he not played in a particular system and under a coach that was patient with him, he may not have been as successful as he was.\\nSome would say that there is a player in today's league that could draw similarities to Dennis Rodman. Draymond Green did not garner a massive amount of national attention except for his big game performance in his NCAA Tournament appearances with the Michigan State Spartans. However, he was selected in the second round by the Golden State Warriors despite many scouting reports stating that he was not expected to step up as a real contributor.\\nTags: draymond green bio, draymond green basketball, stephen curry, klay thompson, splash brothers, golden state warriors, steve kerr, luke walton, kristaps porzingis\", 'Biographies, Community & Culture, Leaders & Notable People, Biographies, Basketball, Miscellaneous, Biographies', 7, 4.6, 4, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Some of these superstars display unordinary talent at a young age while there are also those whose personalities exceed the technical skill shown on the court. Talent does all of the hard work on the court, but a player's character and demeanor on and off of it are what define his future as a superstar. There are those that showed potential as superstars but ultimately failed because they lacked the personality, character, and demeanor to become great.\\n However, there are those NBA players that have never shown superstar talent or even the potential for joining the league at an early age yet have the personality and demeanor of one destined for greatness. These are the silent workers and discreet assassins that bide their time under the radar without making noise that draws attention. Additionally, there are the players that may resemble background players because of their demeanor and lack of star-quality personality, but they have the work ethic and desire to become great.\\nThough they are not as big as players like Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, or LeBron James when it comes to their personalities, these silent assassins are just as talented and impactful as any other significant player in league history.\\nTags: kawhi leonard bio, kawhi leonard story, kawhi leonard basketball, tim duncan, tony parker, manu ginobili, danny green, gregg popovich, paul george\", 'Biographies, Community & Culture, Leaders & Notable People, Biographies, Basketball, Miscellaneous', 6, 4.2, 6, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

The long-distance lorry driver deals with life in the raw, with many hardships and occasional comforts. Run-ins with the locals, dramatic encounters with foreign drivers and mechanical problems may be the norm, but they are tempered by the sheer beauty of mountain passes, lakeside stops and the generous hospitality of the people he meets. The camaraderie in the trucking fraternity has seen Paul through many a crisis, and he shares the belief that help is always at hand when a fellow driver is facing a problem. Take a ride through foreign lands in the cab of a long-haul lorry for an insider's perspective on overland travel. Paul Rowlands was born in The Rhondda, South Wales. His first job was with the Civil Service, but his love for travel led to his becoming a long-distance truck driver. He lives in Ipswich, Suffolk and continues to work as a truck driver/roadie.

One of the first challenges to the orthodoxy of unfettered free trade, this book undertakes a comparison between the economies of the United States and Germany - who used protectionism - and the economy of Great Britain, which was broadly aligned to free trade. List demonstrates that the unbridled free trade acts to foster inequality and lopsided development; in the case of the British Empire, the colonized lands benefit far less than the colonizers. Domestic industry in Britain during the 19th century was characterized by extreme poverty of the workers; a dire situation which would eventually spur the creation of trade unions.  List notices that living standards in Germany and the USA during the 19th century consistently rose. In other nations the correlation between tariffs and protectionism, and general living standards for the wider populace, are established. While tariffs on foreign goods were incrementally imposed, the resulting taxes were reinvested into the domestic economy; industry and public infrastructure were improved, and standards for labor were higher, than those in the laissez-faire economy of Great Britain.  A stark opponent of unbridled capitalism, List instead favors a system whereby the state and the business economy work together to create decent conditions for all. He strongly believed that nations had a duty to look after their citizens, create an identity, promote industrial growth and prowess, and regulate both capital and labor to beneficent ends. This is contrasted with free markets, wherein the state's role is minimal and the consequences are shown to be mass exploitation and poverty.  List's body of work, while having faded from view somewhat in the modern day, forms an important milestone in economics. They represent the first major departure from laissez-faire system, and their criticisms of unregulated markets still ring true in the modern day. Although marginalized both during and after his lifetime, and scarcely present in many modern economics courses, Friedrich List's writings were a valuable addition to the discourse.  The translation of the text to English is by Sampson S. Lloyd, a British politician in the late-19th century who agreed with the arguments List presented.\", 'Economics', 1, 4.7, 11, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

It is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived. Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid. He skips school to swim and is made to whitewash the fence the next day as punishment. He cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He then trades the treasures for Sunday School tickets which one normally receives for memorizing verses consistently, redeeming them for a Bible, much to the surprise and bewilderment of the superintendent who thought \"it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\" Book Two: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.

Like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, Detective, the story is told using the first-person narrative voice of Huck Finn. It is a sequel, set in the time following the title story of the Tom Sawyer series. Book Four: Tom Sawyer, Detective Is an 1896 novel by Mark Twain. It is a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and a prequel to Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894).

This is a tremendous tale in which run-ins with the locals, dramatic encounters with foreign drivers, and mechanical problems seem the norm for a long-haul lorry driver. This memoir takes the reader into his world as a truck driver, initially around rural Suffolk and the rest of the UK, before embarking on the Middle East run. The long-distance lorry driver deals with life in the raw, with many hardships and occasional comforts: difficulties are tempered by the sheer beauty of mountain passes, lakeside stops and the generous hospitality of the people he meets. Trucking camaraderie has seen Paul through many a crisis, and he shares the belief that help is always at hand when a fellow driver is facing a problem. The new edition of this hugely popular book incorporates 72 photographs taken at the time, many of which have never been previously published. Born in the Rhondda, South Wales, Paul Rowlands\\' first job was with the Civil Service, but his love for travel led to his becoming a long-distance truck driver. Paul lives in Ipswich, Suffolk and continues to work as a truck driver/roadie. *** \"Exceptionally well written, organized and presented, \\'Not All Sunshine & San\\' is very highly recommended for personal reading lists and community library Contemporary Biography collections, and will have particular interest for non-specialist general readers with an interest in the culture and current history of the Middle East.\"Ë?Midwest Book Review, Library Bookwatch: February 2017, The Biography Shelf[Subject: Transportation, Middle East Studies]', 'Automotive, Travelers & Explorers, Memoirs', 3, 4.6, 12, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

She recounts the lives and times of her family and neighbors during an era gone forever.Remarkable for the vivid details that evoke the past, Rendleman\\'s account is rare in another respect: memoirs of the time—usually written by people from elite or urban families—often reek of nostalgia. But Rendleman\\'s memoir differs from the norm.

They just buy it at the store, ready to eat. A lot buy a steer and have it processed in Dongola and put it in their freezer. What a difference! Girls have got it so easy now. They don\\'t even know what it was like to start out. And I guess my mother\\'s life, when she started out, was as hard again as mine, because they had to make everything by hand. I don\\'t know if it could get any easier for these girls. But they don\\'t know what it was like, and they never will. Everything is packaged. All you do is go to the store and buy you a package and cook it. Automatic washers and dryers. I\\'m glad they don\\'t have to work like I did. Very glad.\" \\nEdith Bradley Rendleman\\'s story of her life in southern Illinois is remarkable in many ways. Recalling the first half of the twentieth century in great detail, she vividly cites vignettes from her childhood as her family moved from farm to farm until settling in 1909 in the Mississippi bottoms of Wolf Lake. She recounts the lives and times of her family and neighbors during an era gone forever.\\nRemarkable for the vivid details that evoke the past, Rendleman\\'s account is rare in another respect: memoirs of the time―usually written by people from elite or urban families―often reek of nostalgia. But Rendleman\\'s memoir differs from the norm. Born poor in rural southern Illinois, she tells an unvarnished tale of what it was really like growing up on a tenant farm early this century.

One of many riveting reads in the Basketball Biography Books series by Clayton Geoffreys.\\nNewly revised for the start of the 2019-2020 season, Jimmy Butler: The Inspiring Story of One of Basketball's Best All-Around Shooting Guards details the the inspirational story of one of basketball's premier shooting guards, Jimmy Butler. Over the last few years, Jimmy Butler emerged as one of the key leaders of the Chicago Bulls franchise. While Derrick Rose was the leader of the Chicago Bulls for the first few years of Butler's career, Butler became the main leader of the Bulls when Rose unfortunately came down with a series of tough injuries. In the summer 2017, Butler was traded to the Timberwolves to reunite with his old coach, Tom Thibodeau. After a little more than one season with the Timberwolves, Jimmy Butler was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. He stayed one season there before signing with the Miami Heat in the summer of 2019.\\nOnce overlooked in the NBA Draft, as Butler was drafted with the 30th overall pick in 2011, Butler has proven all the scouts wrong on their initial assessments of his abilities, as Butler had demonstrated a high degree of athleticism, basketball intelligence, and influence over games. It will be interesting to watch as Jimmy Butler continues to develop his basketball career, what accomplishments he will be able to achieve. Here is a preview of what is inside this Jimmy Butler biography book:\\nEarly Life and Childhood\\nCollege Years (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior Year)\\nJimmy Butler's NBA Career: Getting Drafted, Rookie Year, Cracking the Rotation, The Start of His Rise, Becoming an All-Star, The New Franchise Player, Final Year in Chicago, The Trade to Minnesota\\nButler's Personal Life\\nJimmy Butler's Impact on Basketball\\nButler's Legacy and Future\\nAn excerpt from this Jimmy Butler biography: Finding the road to success usually comes with a few bumps along the way. Those can include having to deal with a period of not having a permanent home and trying to find places to stay on a nightly basis or having your family kick you out of your home and forcing you to rely on yourself. Sometimes, rewards await those who persevere, and Jimmy Butler is a perfect example of that.\\n Butler's case of starting from poverty to basketball stardom is not a rare one. There have been many players that have gone through similar circumstances. Allen Iverson and his family had lived in deep poverty before he broke out of it when he started starring in Georgetown in college. Kevin Durant was similarly situated. His mother had to support him and his brother by herself as they jumped from apartment to apartment. Even LeBron James had to suffer through poverty when his mom had him in her teens. However, Butler's story has a slight difference in how those other basketball superstars got out of poverty. Jimmy had to work his way up to it intensely.\\n The thing about Jimmy Butler is that his NBA stardom was not as apparent and as quick as some of the league's best players. His debut did not carry the same weight as some of his peers who came straight out of high school or after just one season in college basketball.Did you like this excerpt?

From Ron\\'s introduction: \"The wonderful thing about Radio as it used to be in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, is that whoever or whatever you were hearing over the airwaves was your very own visual creation. It was your imagination that supplied the images of what the people, places and situations you heard looked like. The \"pretty\" girl was your version of what \"pretty\" was… and the \"handsome\" hero was your visualization of what constituted \"handsome.\" During the memorable years when Radio was America’s favorite home entertainment medium, the airwaves were permeated with all sorts of programming. There were the daytime dramas of domestic stress, or soap operas as they were called because they were usually sponsored by soap detergent companies, that at-home moms and night-working dads could tune in to hear and sometimes their sick-at-home--with-a-cold kids also listened to \"the soaps.\" There were the five-day-a-week children’s adventure serials that were heard in the late afternoon when youngsters came home from school. There were prime-time mystery programs, and comedy and variety shows, game and panel programs, and even adaptations of great works of the theater and literature, as well as radio versions of well known films, for the mind’s eye to envision.\"', 'Humor, Radio, Performing Arts', 3, 4.5, 4, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Some such questions being:  If I had an imaginary friend as an adult, what would they be like? Do I disguise my emotions well? What is my definition of beauty? If I wrote a memoir, what would it be called? What habits do I want to cultivate? Am I good at sports? Do I want to be?

Now they have chosen and reviewed the one hundred best business titles of all time—the ones that deliver the biggest payoff for today’s busy readers.The 100 Best Business Books of All Time puts each book in context so that readers can quickly find solutions to the problems they face, such as how best to spend The First 90 Days in a new job or how to take their company from Good to Great. Many of the choices are surprising—you’ll find reviews of Moneyball and Orbiting the Giant Hairball, but not Jack Welch’s memoir. At the end of each review, Jack and Todd direct readers to other books both inside and outside The 100 Best. And sprinkled throughout are sidebars taking the reader beyond business books, suggesting movies, novels, and even children’s books that offer equally relevant insights.

Destroying almost three billion rubles’ worth of property in European Russia between 1860 and 1904, accidental and arson fires acted as a brake on Russia’s economic development while subjecting peasants to perennial shocks to their physical and emotional condition. The fire question captured the attention of educated, progressive Russians, who came to perceived it as a key obstacle to Russia’s becoming a modern society in the European model.Using sources ranging from literary representations and newspaper articles to statistical tables and court records, Frierson demonstrates the many meanings fire held for both peasants and the educated elite. To peasants, it was an essential source of light and warmth as well as a destructive force that regularly ignited their cramped villages of wooden, thatch-roofed huts. Absent the rule of law, they often used arson to gain justice or revenge, or to exert social control over those who would violate village norms. Frierson shows that the vast majority of arson cases in European Russia were not peasant-against-gentry acts of protest but peasant-against-peasant acts of \"self-help\" law or plain spite.Both the state and individual progressives set out to resolve the fire question and to educate, cajole, or coerce the peasantry into the modern world. Fire insurance, building codes, \"scientific\" village layouts, and volunteer firefighting brigades reduced the average number of buildings consumed in each blaze, but none of these measures succeeded in curbing the number of fires each year.More than anything else, this history of fire and arson in rural European Russia is a history of their cultural meanings in the late imperial campaign for modernity. Frierson shows the special associations of women with fire in rural life and in elite understanding of fire in the Russian countryside. Her study of the fire question demonstrates both peasant agency in fighting fire and educated Russians\\' hardening conviction that peasants stood in the way of Russia\\'s advent into the company of prosperous, rational, civilized nations.', 'Europe, Russia, True Crime', 3, 4.5, 10, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

In What to Read When, award-winning educator Pam Allyn celebrates the power of reading aloud with children. In many ways, books provide the first opportunity for children to begin to reflectively engage with and understand the world around them. Not only can parents entertain their child and convey the beauty of language through books, they can also share their values and create lasting connections. Here, Allyn offers parents and caregivers essential advice on choosing appropriate titles for their children—taking into account a child’s age, attention ability, gender, and interests— along with techniques for reading aloud effectively. But what sets this book apart is the extraordinary, annotated list of more than three hundred titles suitable for the pivotal moments in a child’s life.

Word of Mouth, edited by Bowman, brings together the poems that have been featured on NPR, providing a window onto the dynamic contemporary poetry scene. A child playing with flashes of sunlight in the aisle of an airplane; a woman describing tropical fruit to someone in a faraway country; a man building a deck with his dead father’s hammer; the musings of a Barbie doll participating in a 12-step program: these poems powerfully and lyrically transform the stuff of every day life. A celebration of the poetic voice that includes 33 acclaimed writers, this vibrant anthology proves beyond any doubt that poetry is far more than just words on paper.Quincy Troupe • Czeslaw Milosz • Campbell McGrath • C.D.

Authors Holly Genzen and Anne McCrary Sullivan entice with their favorite day- and overnight trips from various Everglades departure points. Having spent years exploring this maritime labyrinth, the authors now share their intimate knowledge of historic Everglades rivers and bays, the endless horizon of its Gulf Coast, the eerie beauty of its mangrove forests, and the secrets of ancient tribes and early-American pioneers who left their distinctive traces. Descriptions of wildlife abound (the birds! the alligators!), as do the details of exquisite flora that flourishes here. But Genzen and Sullivan do not skimp on practicalities nor on threats to this environment. Safety, weather, insects, food, fresh water, and camping on rustic \"chickee\" platforms stilted above the rivers all earn many pages here. As does what lies in store for the timeless but fragile Everglades ecology.

Un alegato a favor de mantener el espíritu lúdico de la infancia en la edad adulta, para seguir siendo creativos.»\\u2000 --THE OBSERVER \\xa0 MÁS DE 350 MILLONES DE CUBOS VENDIDOS \\xa0 «Toda nuestra vida consiste en resolver puzles.» --Erno Rubik \\xa0 Desde su creación en 1974, el cubo de Rubik ha vendido más de 400 millones de ejemplares. Pese a que pocos saben resolverlo, su creador Erno Rubik asegura que cualquiera podría haberlo inventado. Esta es la historia de un célebre juego, pero también la del hombre que hay detrás: uno que ya de niño adoraba los puzles geométricos y que de ahí en adelante se encargó de imaginar muchos otros juegos posibles. Uno que jamás dejó de divertirse y de soñar con nuevos rompecabezas e ingenios matemáticos, y que sin quererlo inventó uno de los objetos más icónicos de todos los tiempos. Rubik son unas memorias repletas del ímpetu nostálgico y la humildad de un genio. Pero no solo son unas memorias, son mucho más que eso. Son también una explicación única del proceso creativo, un manual para el paciente e imperfecto arte de la invención, y una invitación al acto más puro y creativo de todos: jugar. \\xa0 ENGLISH DESCRIPTION  The first book by the reclusive inventor of the world\\'s most iconic puzzle THE RUBIK\\'S CUBE. Erno Rubik inspires us with what he\\'s learned in a lifetime of creating, curiosity, and discovery. \\xa0 Erno Rubik was a child when he first became obsessed with puzzles of all kinds. \"Puzzles,\" he writes, \"bring out important qualities in each of us: concentration, curiosity, a sense of play, the eagerness to discover a solution.\" To Rubik puzzles aren\\'t just games―they\\'re creativity machines. He encourages us to embrace our inner curiosity and find the puzzles that surround us in our everyday lives. \"If you are determined, you will solve them,\" he writes. Rubik\\'s own puzzle, the Cube, went on to be solved by millions worldwide for over forty years, become one of the bestselling toys of all time, and to be featured as a global symbol of intelligence and ingenuity. \\xa0 In Cubed, Rubik covers more than just his journey to inventing his eponymous cube. He makes a case for always being an amateur―something he has always considered himself to be. He discusses the inevitability of problems during any act of invention. He reveals what it was like to experience the astonishing worldwide success of an object he made purely for his own play. And he offers what he thinks it means to be a true creator (hint: anyone can do it). Steeped in the wisdom and also the humility of a born inventor, Cubed offers a unique look at the imperfect science of creation.', 'Puzzles & Games, Psychology & Counseling, Mathematics, Technology, Engineering', 5, 4.3, 10, 'Good', 'Neutral')\n",

He was a contemporary and collaborator with James Watt, with whom he worked on an early steam car, contributor to the 1797 Encylopedia Britannica, professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and inventor of the siren.Although Robison was very much an advocate of science and rationalism, in later life, disillusioned by the French Revolution, he became an ardent monarchist. In this work, Proofs of a Conspiracy, Robison laid the groundwork for modern conspiracy theorists by implicating the Bavarian Illuminati as responsible for the excesses of the French Revolution. The Bavarian Illuminati, a rationalist secret society, was founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776 in what is today Germany. They had an inner core of true believers, who secretly held radical atheist, anti-monarchist and possibly proto-feminist views, at that time considered beyond the pale. They recruited by infiltrating the numerous (and otherwise benign) Freemasonic groups which were active at the time on the continent. Necessarily they had a clandestine, compartmentalized, hierarchical organizational form, which has led some modern conspiracy theorists to identify them as the original Marxist-Leninist group. However, this is most likely simply a case of parallel evolution.Since we don't have convenient access to the source documents of the Bavarian Illuminati we have to rely on Robison and the AbbÃ© Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism, both in the 'opposing views' category, for information on this group. The Illuminati have today become a byword for a secret society which hoodwinks its junior members and puppet-masters society at large. This reputation is in no little part due to Robison's book.

It is a small-scale form of vegetable growing. A vegetable garden typically includes a compost heap and several plots or divided areas of land, intended to grow one or two types of plant in each plot. Many families have home kitchen and vegetable gardens that they use to make food. In World War II, people had gardens called a 'victory garden' which provided food to families and thus freed up resources for the war effort.With the increased interest in organic and sustainable living, many people are turning to vegetable gardening as a supplement to their family's diet. Food grown in your own backyard, uses up little if any fuel for shipping, and the grower can be sure of what exactly was used to grow it. Organic horticulture, or organic gardening, has become increasingly popular for the modern home gardener.There are many types of vegetable gardens. Potagers, a garden in which vegetables, herbs and flowers are grown together, has become more popular than the more traditional rows or blocks.

However, the transport industry is constantly evolving and companies must adapt their vehicles to keep pace with the developments. As a result, vehicle design and liveries regularly change. Many of the companies around in the 1980s have expired and been forgotten. Most of the trucks from that time are long gone to the great scrapyard in the sky! David Wakefield has been working in the transport industry for over 30 years and has been taking photographs of trucks since the early 1980s. He has amassed thousands of high-quality images, producing one of the most comprehensive photographic collections of the time, but many of his photographs have never been previously published. In this vivid compilation, Nick Ireland has collated 300 of David's images from the 1980s in order to preserve them and make them publicly available for the first time. The book features trucks from all over the world, and it is a must-have for current and former truckers who will enjoy being reminded of 'the good old days,' as well as anyone else with an interest in transport history.

Reuchlin's response to the situation could be summed up as: Do not burn what you do not understand. Reuchlin brought revilement and persecution upon himself, but his courageous defense of Jewish books put an end to the attempt to destroy them.

Jordan Sr. was a former air force man who also played semi-pro baseball. After studying airplane hydraulics in Brooklyn, James Jordan and his wife Deloris decided to move their family back to Wilmington, North Carolina to flee the increasingly dangerous neighborhoods of Brooklyn, NY.\\\\nJames and Deloris met at a basketball game in 1954. They quickly fell in love and dated for the next three years before getting married and welcoming their first child in 1957. While Michael was the most well-known of the kids, he was definitely not the only child. James and Deloris had five kids in total, three boys and two girls.\\\\nLarry Jordan, James R. Jordan Jr., and Deloris Jordan were Michael\\'s older siblings. MJ also had a younger sister named Roslyn. We can see the origins of MJ\\'s competitive nature if we study his childhood, namely his early experiences with racism and competitions with his brothers.\\\\n\"At the time you had racism all over North Carolina -- all over the United States -- and it was a lot of it around here\" said Jordan.\\n\"So, as a kid, it was like, this is where I don\\'t want to be. I want to excel outside of this. So my motivation was to be something outside of Wilmington.\"\\\\nMJ grew up wanting to use athletics as a vehicle to get to a better life. A life where he could journey far away from Wilmington and be able to distance himself from the racism he was experiencing.\\nQuestion to Ponder: How do you think experiencing racism made MJ feel and impacted his life? How would you deal with racism in your own life?\\nThe other source of Jordan\\'s competitiveness came from his older brother, Larry. Growing up, Larry was a better basketball player than Michael and was able to use his advantages in strength and size to best his younger sibling. Larry was also the most competitive of all his siblings.\\\\n\"When you come to blows with someone you absolutely love, that\\'s igniting every fire within you. And I always felt like I was fighting Larry for my father\\'s attention. ... When you\\'re going through it, it\\'s traumatic, because I want that. I want that approval, I want that type of confidence. So my determination got even greater to be as good if not better than my brother.\" Michael said.\\nThe quote shows a window into some of the pain that MJ grew up with. His life wasn\\'t all flowers and daisies. He experienced racism, fought his siblings for his father\\'s attention, and went through traumatic events. Yet what made MJ special was his ability to use painful events to fuel him and help him strive for a better life. He could have decided to stay home and refuse to play when his father favored his brother Larry, or when his community favored those with a different skin color.\\nInstead Michael got up, worked hard, and achieved his dreams.\\nQuestion to Ponder: Do you think it\\'s okay to fight with your siblings? How can two siblings have a healthy rivalry while still loving each other?\\\\n...Scroll up and Buy Now to Read the Rest!', 'Leaders & Notable People, Professionals & Academics, Biographies', 3, 4.7, 6, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Allen and Sharon Biggs. This 480-page volume, elaborately illustrated by world-renowned horse photographer Bob Langrish, is divided into eleven sections, covering topics that span the world of horses, from evolution and domestication to horse riding, training, competitions and more.Section 1: History, Physiology, and Behavior” discusses the natural history of the horse, including adaption, migration, and domestication, how horses became integral to human kind, the role of horses in society (war horses, law-enforcement horses, race horses), as well as animal welfare and the plight of wild and feral horses. The anatomy and physiology of the horse are detailed in discussions of the horse’s bodily systems, structure, senses, gait/movement, and coat and color patterns. In terms of behavior, the authors discuss the life cycle of the horse and reproduction, intelligence and trainability, and horse mentality and natural instincts.In Section 2: Breeds and Types,” the authors trace the evolution of modern horse types from three known ancient ancestors and archaic types and extinct breeds. They describe the modern types of horses based on their particular looks and specific uses (Baroque, Cob, Hack, Hunter, Polo Pony and so forth). A detailed discussion of horse color follows, explaining the differences between each and what specific characteristics define each (buckskin, palomino, and pinto).The extensive breed chapter offers portraits of approximately 175 breeds, alphabetically arranged, from the Abaco Barb to the Welsh Pony, including many rare and handsome breeds from around the world as well as favorites like the American Quarter Horse, the Shetland Pony and the Thoroughbred. Main entries provide alternative names, region of origins, brief history, and physical descriptions for each breed. Sidebars called Breed in Brief” offer concise overviews of the lesser known breeds.The popular hobby of horse riding is the focus of Section 3: Activities with Horses,” which describes English, western, and driving competition as well as rodeo, competitive trail riding, vaulting, polo, and other horse sports. Section 7: Rider Instruction” continues the discussion on riding with chapters on riding instructions, safety and fitness as well as English and western riding skills.In Section 4: A New Horse” and Section 5 Horsekeeping,” the Bible becomes a primer for all horse owners offering detailed information about choosing the right horse for novice riders, families, and experienced riders and purchasing the horse and the proper equipment (saddles and bridles, boots, gear, and gadgets). The section concludes with chapters on transporting horses, stabling and boarding, and feeding and grooming. Section 6: Health” discusses veterinary care and vaccines, recognizing the signs of a healthy animal, first aid for each area of the horse’s anatomy, hoof care, and winter wear. A complete chapter is dedicated to battling parasites and pests and avoiding poisonous plants in the horse’s environment. A chapter on alternative care completes the section.Section 8:”Horse Training” focuses on various training philosophies and early handling, training lessons, solving training problems (leading, bolting, biting/nipping, rearing/buckling and shying).Section 9: Competition” is dedicated to horse shows and classes, preparation for various kinds of shows for both the horse and the rider, and what to expect at the show. These chapters are filled with priceless firsthand advice and pointers from the authors about how to succeed at each of these events.Section 10: Breeding Mares and Raising Foals” offers a complete overview of the reproduction of horses, with details on choosing a stallion, live cover versus artificial insemination, pregnancy, delivery, and care, imprinting, and handling of the young. Section 11: The Senior Horse” discusses the horse’s golden years, signs of aging, nutrition and care, retirement from activities, and general care for aging animals. Horse owners will find symptoms and treatment for sixteen of the most common equine aliments (found in the appendix) to be of great utility, as are the resource section and complete index at the end of the volume.', 'Pets & Animal Care, Individual Sports, Agricultural Sciences', 3, 4.6, 11, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

Do you know where Post-modernism stops and Post-structuralism begins? Would you like to? From Platonism to New Historicism, humankind is constantly coming up with fresh schools of thought to help explain (or at least describe) the mysterious world around us. Here is the ultimate guide to over 450 of the most significant intellectual terms, movements, and religions that help shape the society we live in. Simply, concisely, and with personality, ‘Isms and ‘Ologies clarifies buzz terms like jihad, often defined as “holy war” but which literally means “striving” ;and illustrates the differences between Conservatism, Paleoconservatism, and Neoconservatism. It explains String Theory (which attempts to unify Quantum Mechanics and Einsteinian Relativity); describes Fauvism (an artistic movement that paved the way for Expressionism and Cubism); defines Locofocoism (an American political ideology named after a “self-lighting cigar)”; and identifies and explores so much more. Helpfully divided into categories–including politics, history, philosophy and the arts, economics, religion, science, and medicine–cross referenced, and thoroughly indexed, ‘Isms and ‘Ologies is a must have for the budding intellectual in everyone.', 'Philosophy, Social Sciences, Sociology, Dictionaries & Thesauruses, Encyclopedias & Subject Guides, Trivia & Fun Facts, Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 7, 4.6, 11, 'Excellent', 'Happy')\n",

(Click on Author name to see all the journals.) Scroll to the bottom to see the difference between this and the original version. Please see reviews for alternative binding ideas.\\\\nTHE UNRIPE GARDEN\\'S JOURNAL, PLANNER & LOG BOOK is a book of garden forms with the flexibility needed to personalize your style of record keeping. Every form is designed to include all the information needed, while minimizing the amount of time required. Get the \"inside dirt\" on the reasons and knowledge useful for each form, culled from experienced gardeners.\\\\nSO WHY DO YOU NEED A GARDEN JOURNAL? ~ Here\\'s why:\\nEven more valuable than your favorite garden trowel or spade is a written record of what works in your garden. While gardening books, apps and the internet are full of great advice, they can\\'t replace personal experience. (And what happens when technology fails?)\\\\nYour garden is in your micro-climate and soil. Perennials in one part of the country aren\\'t perennials in another. The labels on the plants you buy can be misleading--they may be correct in the location of origin, but not where you live.\\\\nThere are simply too many plants and too many variables for anyone to remember from year to year what worked where, and what didn\\'t and why. You need to remember what works for you--in your garden.\\\\nEvery gardener faces repeat attacks of pests or disease and needs to remember which treatment worked and which did more harm than good. Every gardener has weeded out emerging perennials, forgetting what they planted where. Every gardener needs a memory.\\\\nYOUR GARDEN WILL LOOK LIKE ART,\\nbut you will know that\\nTHE GARDEN JOURNAL, PLANNER & LOG BOOK\\nis the science behind your success.\\\\nBook Content Comparison: (There are in general more of each form in the original garden journal.

And it is with that in mind that I am writing this book.\"So What Is This Way That I Can Make Money?The source of some good cash that I found was selling used books online through Amazon, the largest online retailer in the world. Amazon has over 200,000,000 credit card numbers on file, and they actually help you to sell your books. You list them online through Amazon, millions of people look at those listings every day, and untold numbers of books are sold daily, including yours! What Does It Cost To Get Started?Actually, it will cost you little or nothing to get started. Finding those books around the house, on shelves, on top of the dresser, in the closets, in the attic is the first place to start your business. Research the pricing and list the book on Amazon. Then, watch the sales start to come in. There are also a lot of places you can go to find used books at reasonable prices which you can then list with a higher price than you paid. I\\'ll reveal those places in the pages of this book.How Much Can I Make Selling Used Books Online?Of course, the answer to that question is really how much do you want to earn. There are many people who do it as a hobby and make a hundred or so monthly. And then there are people who do it as a business and make several thousand dollars monthly. That is up to you. I always remind myself that Amazon began in someone\\'s garage, selling used books online. Today, they are one of the largest businesses in America. So how much can you make? The sky is the limit!In Reality, What Will This Book Do For ME?In this book, I\\'ll tell you:How to find books -How to increase your inventory of books --How to research for the right price to list your book at --Detailed instructions on how to list your book and how to rate its condition --How to package your book for shipment --The best way to ship and add postage --And other important information that you should be aware of.The Final Conclusion Then Is:So how can you go wrong with this book? You can start with what you have around the house, add to your inventory from other sources, package books daily for shipment, and get instant access to your profits through PayPal. Sell a few ... Sell a lot. It really is up to you. And, you can start today. Really now, what more could you ask?', 'Business Technology, Processes & Infrastructure', 2, 3.8, 9, 'Average', 'Sad')\n",

In All Countries (1934) collects pieces on Russia in the late 1920s, Mexico in the aftermath of Zapata, the troubled Spanish Republic, and strikes and protests in the United States, while articles that appeared in Journeys Between Wars (1938) examine France under the Popular Front and the Spanish Civil War.Also included are A Pushcart at the Curb (1922), a cycle of poems inspired by his travels; nine political and literary essays written between 1916 and 1941, including his denunciation of the execution of his friend José Robles by Spanish Communists; and a selection of letters and diary entries from 1916 to 1920 that record his wartime service as an ambulance driver in France and Italy.

From encouraging risk-taking to determining tangible benefits, this book provides valuable insight for those looking to master the business of innovation.

Learn How To Prepare 37 Delicious Wheat Free Foods, Lose Weight, Feel Better And Gain A Lot Of Energy!  We tend to overlook the nutritional content of any delicacy in the urge to savor it. We tend to rate the food based on its flavor, presentation and complexity in preparation, but seldom do we rate it based on how healthy it is for our body. The major reason for the decreased stamina in this generation is because of the lack of healthy food habits.  The innocent looking wheat that is almost present in all your junk foods is quite deceiving after all. Wheat can cause serious health damages even to people who are not allergic to it or suffer from Celiac disease. Never underestimate the perils of high wheat content diet, for it can cause serious cardiac issues and even cause cancer. If Wheat is an essential part of all the foodstuffs, then how do we relish yummy food again?  Another preconceived notion that plagues us is that healthy foods are not tasty and are fit to suit the needs of an elderly person.

Grant spent many months photographing throughout Arizona to capture the images for this book. He also traveled to Costa Rica to photograph a tropical jungle similar to the one that once existed in Arizona. If he couldn’t get the image he needed, Grant used a tablet to draw parts of the landscape, including clouds and light beams. Grant carefully blended Stephanie’s artwork into his images. He adjusted the lighting and shadows on the people and animals to match the lighting in the photographs.\\\\nStephanie Lowman has been sketching and painting for over thirty years. Bringing to life past and present scenes from Arizona was one of her most challenging tasks. Stephanie studied fossils of prehistoric creatures and compared them to fossils of living animals to learn how they might have looked. She then spent countless hours drawing all of the animals and people line-by-line. Stephanie currently lives in Arvada, Colorado, with her children, Osiris the Dog and Cassidy the Cat. She is the illustrator of all of the \"Dreaming of...\" series of books.\\\\nView all of the books in the \"Dreaming of...\" series in the \"From the Publisher\" section above: Dreaming of Space Dreaming of Colorado Dreaming of Rocky Mountain National Park Dreaming of Arches National Park Dreaming of California\\\\nDreaming of Arizona tells the story of Harlow the Hawk, who does not want to go to sleep.

Each of Harlow’s adventures is based on real events that occurred in Arizona.\\\\nThis book combines vivid illustrations drawn by Stephanie Lowman with dramatic photos taken by Grant Collier.
